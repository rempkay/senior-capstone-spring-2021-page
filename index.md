## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rempkay/senior-capstone-spring-2021-page/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Introduction

In the beginning of our project, our main objective is to give governments, police enforcement law and authority to identify persons during a pandemic. For a little background information, during the year of 2020 and forward, society has adapted to a new lifestyle of how to protect themselves health wise while in public environment. Compiling with a new policy of mask wearing has its pros and cons, it will protect a person's health but will everyone follow the rule? In addition, how do we know that everyone is wearing a mask? This raises a question of who is actually wearing a mask during the COVID-9 pandemic. These are the questions that have risen in our research experiment and that will help us identify what it takes to build a AI model for government control.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rempkay/senior-capstone-spring-2021-page/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
